Motivation for Development: 

In a time of global pandemic and social distancing, people are relying more than ever on at-home  streaming services as a source of entertainment. We wanted an application to provide specific movie and show recommendations based on user input.

User Story: 

For the user that is looking for a new movie or television show to watch. The user may enter the title of a movie or show that they enjoyed, and Title Dive will provide eight recommendations of titles similar to the one entered. The user may select from the recommended titles and be redirected to a show page with additional movie/show information and watch a trailer of their recommended program.

Process:

Technologies Used: html, css, bootstrap, jQuery, javaScript

Breakdown of tasks and roles:
  Chase Edwards: JavaScript, JQuery, API Research
  Briant Kutsar: Main page components and styling
  Justin Lucas.: Main page components and styling
  Suzanne Jucaitis: Show page components and styling, Presentation

Challenges:
  CORS error, an error due to a security mechanism that browsers implement
  Sharing files

Successes:
  We were able to meet our original goal of connecting users to new titles based off of their interest
  
 Ideas for Future Development:
  1. Create similar app for book and podcast recommendations using same technologies
  2. Monetize site with ads and affiliate links
  3. Provide information on streaming platform availability for selected titles on the show page 
  4. Optimizing search capability
